**Project Title:-** WaterSaver â€“ Helping Residents Conserve Water During Emergency Pipe Repairs  
  
**Phase 1:-** Understanding the Problem, Exploring Causes, and Validating a Solution  
**Project Overview**  
 The lack of real-time feedback and communication during emergency water pipe repairs is a major problem that urban populations experience, and our solution, WaterSaver, aims to solve it. Residents are frequently told to save water at such occasions. But in the absence of frequent updates or real-time consumption statistics, many users either disregard conservation requests or don't know how to properly modify their usage. Longer maintenance times, needless water waste, and decreased citizen-municipality cooperation are the outcomes of this.  
  
**Problem Statement**  
Our main problem is that residents do not have access to timely, actionable feedback during emergency water conservation periods.  Nowadays, a lot of municipalities rely on passive communication techniques like email or public announcements, which are frequently disregarded and delayed.  By providing homeowners with real-time water usage data, alarms, and customized conservation tips, our app seeks to change this.  
  
**The Importance of This Issue**  
 Not only is efficient water conservation important for the environment, but it is also essential for emergency infrastructure management and municipal planning.  Noncompliance with conservation requests by citizens results in:  
* Longer repair times as a result of pressure imbalances
* Higher expenses for resources
* Residents' and city workers' frustration
* Increased probability of recurrent pipeline failure
  
 Cities dealing with deteriorating infrastructure, rising water demands, and stress from the environment make this issue even more pressing.  
  
**Problem Breakdown**  
  
Component | Details  
--- | ---  
**Root Cause** | Lack of accessible, real-time water usage data and clear guidance during emergency restriction periods.  
**Observed Effects** | - Low compliance with conservation efforts  <br> - Prolonged repair operations  <br> - Frustrated stakeholders  <br> - Increased water waste  
**Hypothesis** | If residents receive personalized water usage feedback and targeted tips through a mobile app, water consumption during emergencies will decrease significantly.  
**Proposed Solution** | **Build WaterSaver**, a mobile app that provides:  <br> - Real-time water usage tracking  <br> - Alerts for restrictions or overuse  <br> - Personalized water-saving tips  <br> - A community dashboard to promote shared progress  
**Justification** | Research shows that behavioral nudges and real-time feedback (e.g., *Opower* for electricity) can significantly change user behavior. During the *Cape Town water crisis*, public dashboards and goal-setting helped reduce consumption by over 25%. Mobile apps offer wide reach and usability, making them an ideal solution for urban residents.  
**Expected Outcome** | - Increased public awareness and action  <br> - Faster repair timelines  <br> - Reduced water usage  <br> - Higher resident engagement and municipal trust
