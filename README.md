**Project Title:-** WaterSaver â€“ Helping Residents Conserve Water During Emergency Pipe Repairs  
  
**Phase 1:-** Understanding the Problem, Exploring Causes, and Validating a Solution  
**Project Overview**  
 The lack of real-time feedback and communication during emergency water pipe repairs is a major problem that urban
 populations experience, and our solution, WaterSaver, aims to solve it. 
Residents are frequently told to save water at such occasions. 
But in the absence of frequent updates or real-time consumption statistics, many users either disregard conservation
 requests or don't know how to properly modify their usage. 
Longer maintenance times, needless water waste, and decreased citizen-municipality cooperation are the outcomes of this.
